		| Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
		And some precondition 1
		When some action by the actor
		And some other action
		Then some testable outcome is achieved
		And something else we can check happens too

		This is scenario 2 description
		Given some precondition
		And some other precondition with doc string
		"""
		this is comment
		"""
		When some action by the actor

		Given the cow weighs &lt;weight> kg
		When we calculate the feeding requirements
		Then the energy should be &lt;energy> MJ

		Examples:
